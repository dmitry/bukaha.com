# Bukaha OÜ

## Software Engineering & Consulting

**Hi, I'm Dmitry. With 18+ years of experience and contributions to Ruby on Rails core, I run Bukaha OÜ - a software consultancy company based in Estonia. I partner directly with businesses to build scalable, maintainable software that actually solves problems and drives growth.**

As a father of two daughters and a remote work veteran, I understand the importance of reliability, clear communication, and delivering on promises. I've been working remotely for over 13 years, perfecting the art of asynchronous collaboration while maintaining the personal touch that makes projects successful.

## How I Work

### Engineering Philosophy
I believe in building software that lasts. This means:
- **Clean Architecture** - Code that's a joy to work with years later
- **Comprehensive Testing** - Sleep well knowing your system is bulletproof
- **Smart Documentation** - Your future team will thank you
- **Pragmatic Decisions** - Balancing perfection with shipping features
- **Technical Debt Management** - Keeping systems healthy for the long haul

### Project Approach
1. **Deep Understanding** - I invest time to truly understand your business challenges
2. **Collaborative Planning** - We design solutions together, not in isolation
3. **Iterative Delivery** - Regular demos and feedback loops keep us aligned
4. **Knowledge Transfer** - I ensure your team can maintain and extend what we build
5. **Long-term Partnership** - I'm here for the journey, not just the project

### What Makes Me Different
- **Senior-level expertise at boutique prices** - Big company experience, small company flexibility
- **Full ownership mentality** - I treat your project like my own startup
- **EU-based with mobility** - I travel throughout Europe in my mobile home and can visit you anywhere in the EU
- **Real-world perspective** - As a husband and father, I understand work-life balance and realistic deadlines
